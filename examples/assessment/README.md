# CI/CD Pipeline Security Assessment

This directory contains Terraform configurations for assessing the security posture of CI/CD pipelines. The assessment combines multiple data sources to provide a comprehensive view of the pipeline's security context.

## Purpose

This assessment tool is designed for:

- **DevOps Engineers**: To understand what their pipelines can access and what security controls are in place
- **Red Teamers**: To identify potential attack vectors and security gaps in CI/CD pipelines
- **Blue Teamers**: To validate security controls and detect potential misconfigurations

## What It Assesses

The assessment covers several key areas:

1. **Environment Analysis**
   - Identifies sensitive environment variables
   - Maps available environment context

2. **Identity Assessment**
   - Determines cloud provider identity
   - Identifies IAM roles and permissions
   - Maps authentication context

3. **Network Access Assessment**
   - Tests connectivity to common endpoints (GitHub, Docker, cloud providers)
   - Identifies potential exfiltration paths
   - Maps network access patterns

4. **Command Execution Assessment**
   - Tests system command execution capabilities
   - Maps available system information
   - Identifies potential privilege escalation paths

5. **State Analysis**
   - Analyzes Terraform state for sensitive information
   - Maps resource types and providers
   - Identifies sensitive outputs

## Usage

1. Copy the assessment files to your Terraform project
2. Run the assessment:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   ```

3. Review the outputs:
   - `sensitive_env_vars`: List of potentially sensitive environment variables
   - `identity_info`: Identity and authentication context
   - `network_access`: Results of network connectivity tests
   - `system_info`: System information and command execution capabilities
   - `network_info`: Network configuration and open ports
   - `state_analysis`: Analysis of Terraform state
   - `security_assessment`: Summary of security findings

## Security Considerations

- This assessment is designed to be run in a controlled environment
- Some checks may trigger security alerts in your environment
- Review and modify the assessment based on your security requirements
- Consider running this in a staging environment first

## Customization

You can customize the assessment by:

1. Modifying the `common_endpoints` in `pipeline_security.tf` to test different endpoints
2. Adding additional command execution tests
3. Extending the security assessment summary with custom checks
4. Adding more detailed analysis of specific areas

## Output Interpretation

The `security_assessment` output provides a quick overview of potential security concerns:

- `has_cloud_identity`: Indicates if the pipeline has cloud provider credentials
- `has_sensitive_vars`: Shows if sensitive environment variables are present
- `can_access_github`: Tests connectivity to GitHub
- `can_access_docker`: Tests connectivity to Docker Hub
- `can_execute_commands`: Indicates if system commands can be executed
- `has_sensitive_outputs`: Shows if sensitive outputs are present in the state

## Contributing

Feel free to extend this assessment with additional checks and analysis. Consider contributing:

1. Additional endpoint tests
2. More sophisticated command execution tests
3. Enhanced state analysis
4. Additional security checks
